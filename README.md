# RPC-in-browser-console

--Problem--
Create a simple Rock Paper Scissors game in the browser console to learn JavaScript basics.

--Plan--
The game will be played entirely in the browser console. For now, there will be no graphical UI.
The player will enter "Rock", "Paper" or "Scissors". The computer will randomly choose one of these options as well, inform the player of it's selection and inform the player if they won, lost or tied with the computer.
Several games are played in a row until the player either won or lost three games. At this point, the computer declares a winner.

--Pseudocode--
Randomly choose "Rock", "Paper" or "Scissors"
User inputs "Rock", "Paper" or "Scissors"
Return both choices and inform the user if they won, lost or if there is a tie.
Repeat this process until the user won or lost three times and declare them winner or looser accordingly.
